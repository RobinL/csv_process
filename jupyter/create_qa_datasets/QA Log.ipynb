    "* Supplier naming incorrect - id's are named supply0,supply1 etc. but the drop down box retains W End and Old Ln  \n",
    "  \n",
    "* Can't scroll up to remove elements from the summary window (specifically the key) once it's added (as the summary box becomes too large and the hide button disappears).\n",
    "\n",
    "* If two or more demand points lie at exactly the same lat/long position the model will break if the scenario is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Results can change between runs - is it deterministic? e.g. QA test 8 has changed so that medium computational intensity now yields the correct results. Also the extreme verison of test 11 can be different when you re-run the code. (This seems to follow a set pattern though - if you have intensity set to medium, switch to test 11, switch to intensity extreme you get one result (different to the QA log). If you switch to extreme intensity first and then switch to test 11 you get the result from the QA log.\n",

This is likely again due to the slight differences in distances caused when calculating lat/long but it is hard to say.

    "##### Actual Results\n",

    "Capacities - A - supply capable of sustaining 1/8 of demand points, B - supply capable of sustaining 1/6 of demand points, C - supply capable of sustaining 18 demand points.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Predicted Results\n",
    "Previous logic of minimising the furthest away points first does not produce the optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "New theory is that angles away from the vertical should be minimsed - so therefore points furthest to the east and west will be assigned to the bottom supply, as before the top most points will be assigned to the top most supply.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Actual Results\n",
    "Very similar to the previous results - it is difficult to say what the optimal layout is but the it seems to follow a sensible layout and is unlikely to be far from the true optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Checks Completed\n",
    "* Checked that all demand is allocated\n",
    "* Checked that the layout follows the same rules as the previous example but extended so that more demands are allocated to the lowest supply point\n",
    "* Visual check of the map to ensure demands correctly allocated to supplies\n",

    "##### Test Reasons\n",
    "A specific QA check to see whether the model can handle two or more demand points being located at exactly the same latitude and longitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Layout & Parameters\n",
    "Three supplies - vertically aligned - 150km apart\n",
    "\n",
    "Sixteen demands just for the middle supply (B) - at bearings 90 and 270 - Various distances away from supplies but layered in two sets of 8 on top of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Capacities - A - supply capable of sustaining half demand, B - zero supply, C - supply capable of sustaining half demand\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Predicted Results\n",
    "The model will function normally but it will just appear that twice the expected demand is coming from each demand point.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Actual Results\n",
    "The model refuses to select the given scenario 12 and it will lock up the drop down menu so you are forced to refresh the webpage in order to proceed. Error in demand_allocation_layer.js when demand points lie on top of one another.\n",

    "##### Layout & Parameters\n",
    "Three supplies - vertically aligned - two at 0km (A & C) and one 150km away (B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Eight demands just for the middle supply (B) - at bearings 90 and 270 - Various distances away from supplies (in this case no overlapping).\n",
    "\n",
    "Capacities - A - supply capable of sustaining half demand, B - zero supply, C - supply capable of sustaining half demand\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Predicted Results\n",
    "The model will function normally but there will be two distinct regions of demand being allocated into what appears to be a single supply.\n",
